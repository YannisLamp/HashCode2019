# Google Hash Code 2019

Our Approach
--------------

<p>
slides_calc.py contains our solution to the Hash Code 2019 problem.
Initially, combine vertical photos and try to make slides with a normalized number of tags,
as this way, the projected score is maximised. Then sort all slides by number of tags and choose each slide's neighbor 
with the meximum projected score each time by checking the next 200.
